This dir is included only in the UTF8-branch of openmusic

Here are som test patches.  Please fill in with new test-cases:

	README

	patch-w-LATIN1 accents.omp	- LATIN1 patch with accents
	patch-w-UTF8 characters.omp	- same patch in UTF8

	test_ezra.omp
	UTF8-LATIN1-test-WS

	gong1_Shift-JIS.omp		- Japanese encoding
	gong1_UTF8.omp			- UTF8 version of the japanese
	

And a workspace: "UTF8-LATIN1-test-WS" to test importing various
Latin-1 encoded patches.

Check breaks upon import or wrong display of characteres.

Aim is to have all LATIN1-encoded patches imported without errors, and
displayed correctly in OM.

Any imported LATIN1 patches, when saved with the WS or exported, are
expected to be saved w. UTF8-encoding.

* RELEASE NOTES 6.16

  - The precompiled version of OMAudioLib.so included with the
    released version of OM6.16 is now installed and looked up from
    inside OMs resources folder.

    This version of the dynamic library is compiled with GLIBC v.2.27,
    to try to stay compatible with previous and current versions of
    OS'es, and adding "-Wl,--as-needed" to JUCE_LDFLAGS, to not demand
    sometimes conflicting dependencies such as libcurl/libcurl-gnutls,
    which are never needed by OM anyhow.

    The aim is to provide a minimal binary which will run on all
    current 64-bit versions of Linux - Redhat based (Fedora) or Debian
    based (Ubuntu).

    If for some reason you need to compile your own OMAudioLib.so,
    instructions are found together with the sources:

      https://github.com/openmusic-project/omaudiolib

  - various installation names now try to recognize '6' (as in
    'openmusic6', 'om6logo.png') etc. - to allow different versions of
    OM to be installed alongside each other


* RELEASE NOTES 6.15

  - changes, bug-fixes, improvements
  - new function - #'bpf-concat

* RELEASE NOTES 6.14.2

  - new clefs: g_8 and g^8 - the usual treble clef an octave down/up resp.
  - 'Esc'-key works also in analysis mode of Chord-seq (and if there's a selection)
  - #'set-port accepts a list of ports as it's second argument
  - many bug fixes and improvements, check the git sources and logs for detail

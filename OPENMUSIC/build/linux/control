Description:  A graphical programming environment for musical composition. 
 .
 OM may also be used as an all-purpose graphical/visual interface to Lisp programming.
 .
 An object-oriented visual programming environment for musical
 composition based on Common Lisp. It may also be used as an
 all-purpose visual interface to Lisp programming.
 .
 Programs in OpenMusic are created by connecting together (a process
 known as 'patching') either pre-defined or user-defined modules, in a
 similar manner to graphical signal-processing environments such as
 Max/MSP or Pd. Unlike such environments, however, the result of an
 OpenMusic computation will typically be displayed in special musically equipped editors,
 which may be manipulated interactively.  A substantial
 body of specialized libraries has been contributed by users, which extends
 OpenMusic's functionality into such areas as constraint programming,
 aleatoric composition, spectral music, serial music, music theory,
 fractals, music information retrieval, sound synthesis etc.
